ISOINFO(8)                                             ISOINFO(8)

<H2>NAME</H2>
       isoinfo,  isovfy,  inodump  - Utility programs for dumping
       and verifying iso9660 images.

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>
       <b>isodump</b> <i>isoimage</i>

       <b>isoinfo</b> [ <b>-R</b> ] [ <b>-f</b> ] [ <b>-l</b> ] [ <b>-T</b> ] [ <b>-N</b> ] [ <b>-i</b> <i>isoimage</i> ]
       [ <b>-x</b> <i>path</i> ]

       <b>isovfy</b> <i>isoimage</i>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
       <b>isodump</b>  is  a  crude utility to interactively display the
       contents of iso9660 images in order  to  verify  directory
       integrity.   The  initial screen is a display of the first
       part of the root directory, and the prompt shows  you  the
       extent  number  and offset in the extent.  You can use the
       'a' and 'b' commands to move backwards and forwards within
       the  image.   The  'g' command allows you to goto an arbi-
       trary extent, and the  'f'  command   specifies  a  search
       string  to  be used.  The '+' command searches forward for
       the next instance of the search string, and the  'q'  com-
       mand exits <b>isodump.</b>

       <b>isoinfo</b> is a utility to perform directory like listings of
       iso9660 images.

       <b>isovfy</b> is a utility to verify the integrity of an  iso9660
       image.   Most of the tests in <b>isovfy</b> were added after bugs
       were discovered in early versions of  <b>mkisofs.</b>   It  isn't
       all  that clear how useful this is anymore, but it doesn't
       hurt to have this around.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>
       Only the <b>isoinfo</b> program has  any  command  line  options.
       These are:

       <i>-f</i>     generate   output  as  if a 'find . -print' command
              had been run on the iso9660 image.  You should  not
              use the <b>-l</b> image with the <b>-f</b> option.

       <i>-i</i> <i>iso</i><b>_</b><i>image</i>
              Specifies  the  path  of  the iso9660 image that we
              wish to examine.

       <i>-l</i>     generate output as if a 'ls -lR' command  had  been
              run on the iso9660 image.  You should  not  use the
              <b>-f</b> image with the <b>-l</b> option.

       <i>-N</i> <i>sector</i>
              Quick hack to  help  examine  single  session  disc
              files  that  are  to  be written to a multi-session
              disc.  The sector number specified  is  the  sector
              number at which the iso9660 image should be written
              when send to the cd-writer.  Not used for the first
              session on the disc.

       <i>-R</i>
              Extract  information from Rock Ridge extensions (if
              present) for permissions,  file  names  and  owner-
              ships.

       <i>-J</i>
              Use Joliet  directory  records in addition to
              regular iso9660 file names.  This is primarily use-
              ful  when the discs are to be used on Windows-NT or
              Windows-95 machines.    The  Joliet  filenames  are
              specified in Unicode and each path component can be
              up to 64 Unicode characters long.

       <i>-T</i> <i>sector</i>
              Quick  hack  to  help  examine multi-session images
              that have already been burned  to  a  multi-session
              disc.   The  sector number specified is the  sector
              number for the start of the session we wish to dis-
              play.

       <i>-x</i> <i>pathname</i>
              Extract specified file to stdout.

<H2>AUTHOR</H2>
       Eric       Youngdale       &lt;ericy@gnu.ai.mit.edu&gt;       or
       &lt;eric@andante.jic.com&gt;  is   to  blame  for  these  shoddy
       hacks.   Patches  to  improve  general  usability would be
       gladly accepted.

<H2>BUGS</H2>
       The user interface really sucks.

<H2>FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS</H2>
       These utilities are really quick  hacks,  which  are  very
       useful  for debugging problems in mkisofs or in an iso9660
       filesystem.  In the long run, it would be nice to  have  a
       daemon that would NFS export a iso9660 image.

       The isoinfo program is probably the program that is of the
       most use to the general user.

<H2>AVAILABILITY</H2>
       These utilities come with the  mkisofs  package,  and  the
       primary      ftp     site     is     tsx-11.mit.edu     in
       /pub/linux/BETA/cdrom/mkisofs and many other mirror sites.
       Despite the name, the software is not beta.
